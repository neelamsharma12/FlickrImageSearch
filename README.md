# FlickrImageSearch

## The challenge:

Weâ€™d like you to create an app that uses the Flickr image search API and shows the results in a 2-
column scrollable view.

## Requirements:

- Clearly user should be able to search images with specific search term.
- The app should implement lazy loading; it starts by loading only enough data, and
automatically request and display more images when the user scrolls to the bottom of the
view.
- The app should provide history of past search terms.
- Feel free to use any technologies or third party libraries that you are comfortable with.

## Your priorities are:

- Delivering a working app. Quick solutions are acceptable, given the time constraints; just be
ready to discuss your choices.
- Clean code and architecture. Try to make good use of this task to demonstrate and show off
your coding skills.
