# FlickrImageSearch

## The challenge:

Weâ€™d like you to create an app that uses the Flickr image search API and shows the results in a 2-
column scrollable view.

## Requirements:

- Clearly user should be able to search images with specific search term.
- The app should implement lazy loading; it starts by loading only enough data, and
automatically request and display more images when the user scrolls to the bottom of the
view.
- The app should provide history of past search terms.
- Feel free to use any technologies or third party libraries that you are comfortable with.

## Your priorities are:

- Delivering a working app. Quick solutions are acceptable, given the time constraints; just be
ready to discuss your choices.
- Clean code and architecture. Try to make good use of this task to demonstrate and show off
your coding skills.

## Building

1. Double-click on the .xcodeproj or open the project from within XCode
2. In XCode IDE, select Produce / Clean and then Build from the top menu
3. Use the 'Play' (>) button to launch the app on a device or simulator.
4. You will be able to see 2 tabs "search" and "history".
5. Type "Kittens" in the search bar appearing on the top and wait for the results to come on the screen.
6. After this, check that your searched keyword will appear in history section.
7. Like above steps 6, 7 you can search any keyword to view the related images and see that in search history.
